# Garden Town

A blockchain based game where players can play to earn Sunflower Farmer Tokens.


Originally , this open source game brought in over 50K DAU and 350K Blockchain accounts.

The game was not perfect, and the team learned a lot of lessons. It was taken down on January 7th.

The new and improved version is in development and will be live early 2022.

This version of the game is purely experimental and is not recommended to play. There are inherent flaws in the design and it is open for botting and malicious actors to find vulnerabilities. Resources and items crafted are used for in-game mechanics only.
